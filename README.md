## ðŸš€ Features

### 1. `sentence_sectionizer`
Breaks down biomedical or clinical text into structured sections and sentences.

- Identifies common clinical sections (e.g., *History of Present Illness*, *Assessment*, *Plan*)
- Supports custom section headers
- Returns clean sentence-level segmentation for downstream NLP tasks

### 2. `ner` (Named Entity Recognition)
Extracts biomedical entities from unstructured text.

- Recognizes diseases, symptoms, procedures, medications, and anatomical terms
- Built-in support for domain-specific vocabularies
- Outputs entity spans, types, and confidence scores

### 3. `entity_icd` Code Mapping
Maps extracted entities to standardized **ICD-10** codes.

- Uses fuzzy matching and ontology-based lookup
- Supports multiple entity types (diagnoses, procedures, symptoms)
- Returns ICD codes with metadata (description, category)
